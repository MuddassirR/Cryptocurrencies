# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis was to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies and classify them according to similar features. The following methods are used in this analysis:

- preprocessing the database
- reducing data dimensions using principal component analysis
- clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
- visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots

## Results

After the preprocessing and cleaning phase we have 532 tradable cryptocurrencies in our dataset.

### Clustering using K-Means

The best k value appears to be 4, hence, we will use an output of 4 clusters to categorize cryptocurrencies.
